            Capt. Ozzie Gonzalez is a seasoned outdoorsman with over 45 years of experience exploring the diverse landscapes of South Florida. From
            guiding land-based hunting tours to captaining offshore and swamp charter boats, his passion for the outdoors is evident in everything he
            does. Raised in the Coconut Grove area of Miami, his love for nature, particularly the Everglades, began at a young age. He developed a
            deep respect for the wildlife and environment, spending his days fishing, hunting, and exploring the swamps. Capt. Ozzie's expertise
            extends to wood carving, where his intimate knowledge of wildlife shines through in his detailed artwork. Whether leading tours or sharing
            his stories through pictures, Capt. Ozzie is dedicated to educating and inspiring others about the beauty of South Florida's land and sea.
            Whether you speak English or Spanish Capt. Ozzie is guaranteed to educate you with his knowledge and pictures of South Florida's land and
            sea. He loves to have fun and make sure that everyone always wear a smile. It warms his heart to know when anyone purchases one of his
            pieces of Art, you found the same joy and breath taking awe as he did that day taking the picture.
